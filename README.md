Installation
Make sure there are 3 folders: an Images folder, a maps folder and a temp folder.  
If you have Java 7 or newer, to run the program, simply run the jar file.  
An error popup will appear if your Java is not up to date.  
In that case, you must update your java at http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp

Getting Started
Select start on the title screen to start the game.  
Use W, A, S, D to move Up, Left, Down, and Right, respectively.  
Use the arrow keys to shoot in the corresponding direction.  
Go through doors to move to the next room.  
The goal of the game is to collect all the coins!

Features/Notes:
•	The graphic user interface displays your health and coins. 
•	By pressing space you activate a cheat code which will 
      increase your fire rate to the maximum.  
•	Diagonal movement is a feature of this game. 
      In order to move diagonally, simply hold up or down 
      AND left or right at the same time.
•	Every time you enter a new room, you must defeat all the 
      monsters in the room to progress to the next room.
•	When a monster is killed, it has a chance to drop 
      a health pack which will heal you.   
•	The monsters move according to a simple AI in which 
      they always try to move in your direction.
•	When you run out of health a “GAME OVER” message is displayed 
      which shows you how many coins you collected out of the total and you must restart the game to continue.  
•	Instead of pressing the red x button in the top right corner, 
      you can press the quit button on the menu screen to exit the game.
      
Limitations: 
	The maps are not randomly generated as we would have liked, 
	because of the difficulty and time involved with randomly generating maps.  
	Also, several gameplay elements were not included in the interest of time. 
	These included bombs, keys, and bosses.  
	The AI is also quite simple as the monsters constantly try to move in your direction. 
	If we had more time on the project, we could improve the AI so that the monsters
	would try to flank the character so as to make the room more difficult. 
	Stat upgrades were also not implemented in this release. 
	In a future release, we would like to include items which improve max health, damage and speed.
